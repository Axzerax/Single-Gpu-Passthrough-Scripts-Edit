# Single-Gpu-Passthrough-Scripts-Edit
This is an edit of a script I made for single gpu passthrough for people who are having trouble launching their vms on Arch Linux/KDE. This may help and it may not.

Once I get the revert script to work I'll post it here


Original Scripts made by joeknock90.


Note* - This is meant for Nvidia users.
