# Single-Gpu-Passthrough-Scripts-Edit
This is an edit of a script I made for single gpu passthrough for people who are having trouble launching their vms on Arch Linux/KDE. This may help and it may not.

Once I get the revert script to work I'll post it here


You will most likely need edit the script depending on your gpu for the virsh usb parts or it may fail to load.


Original Scripts made by joeknock90.


Note* - This is meant for Nvidia users.
